# Welcome to CasPlay 2.0

This site contains all the information you need to play, as well as a summary of [npcs](npcs.md) and [plot points](plot.md) encountered during play.

## What is it?

CasPlay is a series of whenever/wherever one-shots that coalesce into a bigger story.[^1] 

## Scheduling
We put in our availability via Doodle, and then the DM decides when to have a session and sends out a calendar invitation with a Zoom link.

## Character Generation
The easiest way to make a character is to use the [D&D Beyond Character Builder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/builder). Please use standard array or point buy rather than rolling for stats. You can use material from the PHB and any supplemental books as desired. Aim for an interesting character that you will be excited to play.

## Character Sheets
You can then add your character to the [D&D Beyond campaign](https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/3121548)[^2] (message DM for joining link) or transcribe it to paper. If you are using paper (which is totally fine), please send a picture of your sheet to the DM before the session.

## Levelling Up
Levelling up is done by the number of sessions your character has played. The number of sessions requried to level up increases at various tiers, as follows:

| Level | Sessions |
|-------|----------|
| 1-3   | 1        |
| 4-5   | 2        |
| 6-10  | 4        |
| 11-15 | 6        |
| 16-20 | 8        |

So, for example, to level up to level 4 requires 2 sessions of play, whereas to level up to level 3 only requires one.

## Character levels and tiers
You can continue to play the same character or bring a new character to a session at any time, starting at level one. Once all players have at least one character that has advanced to another "tier" of gameplay, all new and existing characters will advance to at least the lowest level of that tier.

| Level | Tier     |
|-------|----------|
| 1-5   | 1        |
| 6-10  | 2        |
| 11-15 | 3        |
| 16-20 | 4        |

For example, once all players have a character of level six or above, all new characters and existing characters below level 6 will advance to level 6. This just ensures that we don't have characters of wildly differing levels joining a game.

## Relationships

When a new character starts a session, their player has the option to roll a die to determine a random other player's character (e.g. 1d4 if there are four other players) and then roll on 1d20 for a suggested relationship:

 1. Survivors of an ill-fated expedition party
 2. Adopted siblings
 3. Members of a secret society
 4. Former soldiers/sailors/mercenaries together
 5. One of you hid the other from an Orc warband
 6. Grew up together in the same village
 7. Lost a close mutual friend to Orcs
 8. Former solders in a losing war
 9. Former members of a special guild
 10. On the run together from pursuers
 11. Once shared a prison cell
 12. Mutual keepers of an terrible secret
 13. Survivors of a small community destroyed by Orcs
 14. Former enemies that now work together
 15. Former employees from the same defunct business
 16. Former students of beloved teacher
 17. Escaped together from an evil cult
 18. Friendly hunting/gambling/jousting rivals
 19. Worked in the mines together
 20. Failed protectors of a lost artefact

Use this as a loose starting point to then agree on some existing relationship between the two characters. This creates some cohesion, and might explain why this particular party finds themselves on the adventure together.

## One-Shot Structure
We typically play for two hours with a mid-session break unless otherwise agreed. For sake of efficiency, we usually start right away with the mission or quest, and flash back on "how we got here" as needed.

Alternatively, we can play an open session, such as exploring a city, where events are determined randomly by the DM. This can be equally fun. If you have a preference, let the DM know in advance so they don't prepare a structured one-shot unnecessarily.

## Encumberance, Living Costs, etc.
We minimise "bookkeeping" as much as possible in these games. If you want to keep detailed track of such things via the rules in the PHB, go ahead. It is all optional.

## Death
If your character dies and you don't feel done playing them, we can find creative ways to deal with it, such as by employing the spellcasting services listed above. 

If you're happy to let them go, we may find a way to incorporate their memory into the story. The threat of death should be treated realistically and create some sense that life is at stake, but it shouldn't be the end if you don't want it to be.

## Treasure
Treasure is usually divided up equally at the end of the session, and posession of magic items mutually agreed. 

## Communication
We typically communicate between sessions via WhatsApp (request the link from the DM if needed). If you have questions about anything not covered, contact the group or the DM there.

We also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/x7Cgn2QJ) if you're into that kind of thing.
